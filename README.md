# Nexus Language

Nexus is a web-development server and programming language built using Python. It is designed to work as a simple, stand-alone web-server which generates and returns responses to clients. The responses are created using Nexus' web templating language portion, which consists of a tokenizer, parser, and interpreter.

Nexus aims to bridge front-end and back-end development by integrating powerful back-end capabilities with *inline* front-end code including HTML, CSS, and Javascript (or any other text-based client-side scripting). The language also interfaces with popular databases such as MSSQL and MySQL for building database-driven applications. This templating approach simplifies creating websites that are simple, dynamic, repetitive, or anything else. Additionally, Nexus can be used as an API end-point for sending responses to other server applications by serving responses in a variety of data formats including XML, JSON, and binary.

## Project Status

This project is ongoing. As of 05/22/2025 the server portion is mostly complete, the Tokenizer is complete, the Parser is mostly complete (with some parts omitted but with placeholders while the interpreter is developed), and the interpreter is in the earliest stages. 

Thank you for your interest!
