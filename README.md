# Nexus Language

Nexus is a web-development server and programming language built using Python. It is designed to work as a simple, stand-alone web-server which generates and returns responses to clients. The responses are created using Nexus' web templating language portion, which consists of a tokenizer, parser, and interpreter.

Nexus aims to bridge front-end and back-end development by integrating powerful back-end capabilities with *inline* front-end code including HTML, CSS, and Javascript (or any other text-based client-side scripting). The language also interfaces with popular databases such as MSSQL and MySQL for building database-driven applications. This templating approach simplifies creating websites that are simple, dynamic, repetitive, or anything else. Additionally, Nexus can be used as an API end-point for sending responses to other server applications by serving responses in a variety of data formats including XML, JSON, and binary.
